This is a version of JDAAD in which I have added rudimentary blind accessibility; if something is missing or wrong here, let me know. I'm not exactly a JS wiz, and I did get some help from an AI (can't recall which one off the top of my head), so changes may take a while to get added, unless Uto incorporates these changes (specifically, from jdaad.js) into JDAAD proper, in which case I will delete this repo.
